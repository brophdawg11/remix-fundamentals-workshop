# Exercise 5 - Pending and Optimistic UI

TODO:

## Running the app

```sh
# From the repository root
npm run dev -w 5-optimistic-ui

# From the 5-optimistic-ui/ directory:
npm run dev
```

## Steps

1. Slow down add to bag. Stop showing global loading indicator and show "Adding to bag..." and disable the button instead
2. Add cart count to header
3. Optimistic UI for cart count
4. Show a success message with session.flash

## Extra Credit

1. Make selected variant change the image on the left
2. Add query param for selected variant for shareable URLs
3. Add quantity dropdown and ensure this works for optimistic UI
